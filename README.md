# gads

Package gads provides a wrapper for the Google Adwords SOAP API.  Based off of
[emiddleton/gads](https://github.com/emiddleton/gads), this version
was updated to support v201506 and Go 1.5.

Currently this project remains a fork and is a joint effort between
[colinmutter/gads](https://github.com/colinmutter/gads) (working on AWQL,
and Go 1.5 support) and [rfink/gads](https://github.com/rfink/gads)
(working on v201506 compatibility).


## installation

~~~
	go get github.com/colinmutter/gads
~~~

## setup

In order to access the API you will need to sign up for an MMC
account[1], get a developer token[2] and setup authentication[3].
There is a tool in the setup_oauth2 directory that will help you
setup a configuration file.

1. http://www.google.com/adwords/myclientcenter/
2. https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/signingup
3. https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/authentication

Currently, the you need to supply credentials via NewCredentialsFromParams
or NewCredentialsFromFile.  The credentials can be obtained from the file
generated in the previous step.

For example in this CLI script, I am handling a conf file via flags:

    go run cli/adgroups_awql.go -oauth ~/auth.json

NOTE: Other examples still need to be updated to support the removal of the built-in
oauth configuration file flag.

## versions

This project currently supports ~~v201409 and~~ v201506.  To select
the appropriate version, import the specific package:

	  import (
	    gads "github.com/colinmutter/gads/v201506"
	  )


## usage

The package is comprised of services used to manipulate various
adwords structures.  To access a service you need to create an
gads.Auth and parse it to the service initializer, then can call
the service methods on the service object.

~~~ go
     authConf, err := NewCredentialsFromFile("~/creds.json")
     campaignService := gads.NewCampaignService(&authConf.Auth)

     campaigns, totalCount, err := cs.Get(
       gads.Selector{
         Fields: []string{
           "Id",
           "Name",
           "Status",
         },
       },
     )
